This project is a Python-based command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list and prompts the user to guess letters one at a time, updating the displayed word as correct guesses are made. It also tracks incorrect guesses by limiting the number of remaining attempts, providing clear feedback after each guess to guide the player.

Throughout this project, core programming concepts such as loops, conditional logic, lists, and user input handling are demonstrated in a clear and accessible way. The game emphasizes step-by-step problem solving and reinforces foundational Python skills, making it a strong example of beginner-level game logic and interactive program design.

**Code Sample:**

```cpp
import random

word_bank = ["council", "insurance", "spot", "keep", "fascinate", "treatment", "policy", "decisive",
             "dialect", "pat", "fast", "disaster", "rainbow", "siege"] # change to your own words

word = random.choice(word_bank)

display = []
for letter in word:
    display.append("_")

guessed_letters = []
lives = 6

print("Hangman Game")
print(" ".join(display))

while lives > 0 and "_" in display:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    if len(guess) != 1:
        print("Only one letter.")
        print()
        continue

    if guess in guessed_letters:
        print("Guessed that letter already.")
        print()
        continue

    guessed_letters.append(guess)

    if guess in word:
        print()
        print("Correct guess!")
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if word[i] == guess:
                display[i] = guess
    else:
        lives -= 1
        print()
        print("Wrong guess.")
        print("Lives left:", lives)

    print(" ".join(display))
    print("Guessed letters:", guessed_letters)

if "_" not in display:
    print()
    print("You win! The word was:", word)
else:
    print()
    print("Game over. The word was:", word)
```
