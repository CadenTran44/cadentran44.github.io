## Why They Matter ##
My interests specifically in software engineering include things like writing clean, reliable, and maintainable code. I’ve been pretty fascinated by how coding standards can guide not just how code looks, but also how it functions. At first, I thought coding standards were mostly about trivial things, like spaces versus tabs, line breaks, or where to put a curly brace, but I’ve come to see that they can be a powerful tool for improving software quality. Following these coding standards consistently would make code easier to read, easier to debug, and easier to collaborate on.

## Learning Through Standards ##
At the time of writing this, I've used ESLint with VSCode for about a week and a half, and it has shown me how coding standards can also help teach a programming language. ESLint points out more than just stylistic issues. It flags unused variables, possible runtime errors, and risky patterns.

  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>const i = "Hello, World";</code></pre>

    <p><strong>After:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>const i = "Hello, World";</code></pre>
</div>

Even though these errors can feel very tedious and annoying at times, it also forces me to think critically about the language and its features. Over time, I’ve noticed that the mistakes ESLint catches most often are ones I stop making or the ones I fix the fastest, which shows how standards can shape not just the code, but the coder.

## Building Skills and Habits ##
I also want to use coding standards to strengthen my problem-solving and attention-to-detail skills. Writing code that consistently follows rules requires careful thought and foresight, which is similar to debugging or designing systems for reliability. The small mistakes ESLint catches, such as misused functions or inconsistent variable names, often reflect bigger issues that could cause bugs later. Practicing these habits early helps me write safer, more predictable code and builds confidence in my coding abilities.

## Long-Term Focus ##
In the end though, I'm not aiming to become a “rule follower”, as that's too much. Instead, my main goal is to combine strong coding fundamentals with habits that improve code quality, readability, and maintainability. Coding standards, linting tools, and consistent practices all feel like areas where small efforts can make a big difference. As I continue learning, I hope these practices will help me write code that is not only correct, but also clean, efficient, and professional. Code that others can read, understand, and even trust.
