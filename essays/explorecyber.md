## Interests in Security-Focused Software Engineering ##
My main interests in software engineering are areas like cybersecurity, network security, and a bit of cryptography. I’ve always found it interesting how software can be designed not just to work, but to protect data and systems from potential threats. Learning more about how security fits into software development has made me more curious about how vulnerabilities happen and what can be done at the code level to prevent them.

## Goals for Developing Technical Security Skills ##
In the future, I hope to build stronger skills in secure software development and networking concepts. Specifically on how stuff like encryption, authentication, and secure communication work, since these ideas play a major role in cybersecurity and cryptography. Gaining experience with how networks operate and how data moves between systems is something I see as the top priority for understanding how security issues would arise in real-world applications.

## Building up my Abilities ##
I also want to develop better problem solving and analytical skills, since security related work often requires careful attention to detail. Being able to think through problems step by step and understand how systems can fail is something I want to improve over time. Hands-on experiences, such as working through security focused exercises or projects, seem like a good way to build confidence and apply what I learn in a practical way.

## Long-Term Focuses ##
I’m not aiming for anything too extreme, I really just want to get strong fundamentals in software engineering and combine that with security focused knowledge. Cybersecurity, network security, and cryptography all seem like areas where these good coding habits and careful design really would matter. As I continue to learn, I hope to gain the skills and experience needed to work on building secure and reliable systems.
